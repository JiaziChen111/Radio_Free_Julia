# Radio Free Julia
I take Matlab code from well known Economists and rewrite it in Julia (v.0.6.0) 

## Currently in this repo 
- Code by [Ben Moll](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/) (Moll Code)  
  - This code uses finite difference methods to find solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for several models
