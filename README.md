# Radio Free Julia
I take Matlab code from well known Economists and rewrite it in Julia (v.0.6.0) 

I started this project based on my interests in continuous time models. 

If you have any matlab code you would like to see translated into julia you can send suggests to me at clester3 at uoregon.edu 

## Currently in this repo 
- Code by [Ben Moll](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/) (Moll Code)  
  - This code uses finite difference methods to find solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for several models
